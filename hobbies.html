<h1>What do I do when I quit gaming? </h1>
<p1> Honestly, quitting gaming is a weird transition. At some times, it feels like everything is completely empty and barren, but as time goes on everything starts to adjust to normal. </p1>
<p1> The main issue with gaming is the dopamine levels that they release. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain, plays a huge role in everyday life due to how it works. </p1>
<p1> It seems that most people don't really understand how dopamine works. You don't 'get' dopamine, but rather dopamine is released in your brain when you do a pleasurable activity. </p1>
<p1> People don't really seem to understand that game developers main objective is to attract people to play their games and keep them there. That is simply how the economy works, via supply and demand. </p1>
<p1> Games are designed to be addicting. Video games, in and of itself, are not inherently 'bad'. However, modern games have much different intentions then say, Pac-Man, back in the day. </p1>
<h1> How do I choose what hobbies to do? </h1>
<p1> This is a great question but also quite nuanced. With hobbies, the goal is to essentially find multiple hobbies that, when combined together, fulfill all the needs that gaming once did. </p1>
