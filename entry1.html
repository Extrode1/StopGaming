    <h1> Entry #1 - My First Ever Blog </h1>
    <p1> Hello everyone! Welcome to my blog. In this blog I wanted to talk about why knowing about video game addiction is so important. Video game addiction, something that is often overlooked, is an issue that is plaguing today's society quite a bit. 
    I think that video games are often seen as pretty harmless, which does make sense, since most people think it's just a bit of fun and a way to relax after a hard day of work. 
    However, this is only the case for people who are not addicted to gaming. Gaming, like other forms of modern entertainment, is engineered to hook you. 
    Honestly, video game addiction is a pretty tough topic to discuss simply because there's not much awareness around the topic. After all, most people talk about social media as being very concerning, but video games are not really that different. 
    Everyone knows how social media is so damaging but the same principles are really applied everywhere in these modern technologies that they can pretty much all be grouped into one thing. 
    It's all really just instant gratification at the end of the day. There is a time and place for instant gratification, but these kind of things should not be a habit. Rather, it should be done very minimally or not at all. 
    This is not to hate on gaming, but rather to recognize the potential dangers that a video game addiction can cause. 
    In fact, video game addiction is just so under the radar that it seems like no one even talks about it. </p1>
    <br></br> 
    <p1> When I mention video game addiction to other people, usually the responses are pretty negative. It's pretty clear that no one really understands how a video game addiction works, as it is a pretty modern thing. 
    I know that video game addiction (formally known as Internet Gaming Disorder) was only recently recognized by World Health Organization, which is pretty big news for the video game addiction community. 
    Honestly, the biggest thing that is needed is more awareness on the subject. Video game addiction is something that is often overlooked and not really understood due to a lack of research on the topic, as well as a general lack of awareness in mainstream media and the public eye. 
    From my personal experience, most people don't understand how someone can even be addicted to video games. The mechanism of video game addiction is still unclear to this day, with some researchers suggesting that video game symptoms being a symptom of underlying mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, while others suggesting that gaming itself is the addiction. 
    I think addiction in itself is a tricky topic to discuss, as it usually carries quite a negative stigma among people. In fact, the reason why the World Health Organization labels video game addiction as "Internet Gaming Disorder" is because of that negative stigma surrounding video games. 
    Although I am not that familiar with the reasoning behind it, my thinking is that using the term "addiction" makes the person who needs felt feel like they are being blamed in a sense, which can be very uncomfortable and makes things very tricky. </p1>
    <br></br>
    <p1> Anyways, the final goal is to really spread awareness about this issue since I believe it is often misunderstood in today's society. There is a pretty big stigma about gaming in general so gamers do not feel their voices are heard, but in turn this also causes issues with people who are trying to quit gaming. 
    I think that gaming is so normalized that gaming addiction does fly under the radar a bit. I know so many of my friends have struggled with a gaming addiction, but most of them just seem to brush it off without really thinking too much about it. 
    One fond memory that I have of this was in my first year computer science class, where students were comparing how many hours that they had on a particular video game like it was something to brag about, which made me feel a bit uneasy. Knowing how gaming impacted me, I want to make sure others don't go down the same rabbit hole that I did. 
    The point isn't to ostracize gamers but rather to spread awareness of this new issue in society. I honestly think that gaming addiction will be on the rise by significant amounts in the future, possibly reaching unprecedented levels. This is quite unfortunate but might become the new reality for everyone. 
    Anyways, gaming is only one of the many activities that are quite time-consuming and immersive. Of course, there are many other activities that you can indulge in but gaming is the one that I have the most experience with, hence the purpose of this website. My goal is to inform everyone of the dangers of video game addiction
    and provide strategies and approaches that you can take so you can get your life back on track. </p1>
<br></br> 
    <p1> With that being said, the resources of video game addiction are getting so much better over time. You have doctors like HealthyGamer who are healthcare professionals who specialize in gaming addiciton and more awareness around the topic in general. It's easier than ever to quit, but also games are also getting more and more addicting so I suppose it 
        balances out a bit. I personally think that the topic itself is still a bit underlooked, as it is sort of niche in the sense that there are many other issues such as social media addiction that are most likely more widespread and more mainstream as a result of it. Social media addiction is a pretty detrimental addiction as well and actually goes hand and hand with video game addiction. 
        What I mean by this is that when you play games, you don't just play them but you are often involved in communities for these games on social media. This can fuel your addiction quite a bit and it was quite an issue for me. For me specifically, I was pretty involved with social media such as using Twitter, Reddit, Discord and YouTube pretty frequently to consume content about Fortnite. 
        This is an important point to bring as social media and technology in general has done a lot of damage. There are obviously benefits of social media and technology but it is still important to recognize their shortcomings as well. Honestly speaking, there's more shortcomings with social media as the benefits aren't really even that apparent whatsoever. That could actually be a topic I should discuss as well, 
        since social media and gaming addiction are actually very similar (maybe unsurprisingly). I think social media is something that I honestly need to discuss in depth as it is probably one of the biggest issues right now. I think I might even provide some more insight on social media addiction as well. </p1>
