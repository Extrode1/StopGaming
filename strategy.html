    <h1>How do I actually quit gaming? </h1>
    <p1>Frankly speaking, it's complicated. </p1>

<h1> How did you do it? </h1>
    <p1> Quitting gaming isn't something that you can do overnight. It can sometimes feel like a daily battle, never-ending and very painful. However, it doesn't have to be that way. It is clear that
        quitting gaming isn't something that is easy, but that does not mean you have to use a lot of willpower to accomplish this goal. Rather, what I believe is more important is 
        getting rid of potential cues and adding as much friction as possible to reduce the temptation to game. </p1>

    <h1> Strategy #1 - The 90-Day Detox </h1>
    <p1> This strategy is essentially a variation of the dopamine detox but specifically for video games. Originally meant as a way to deal with pornography addiction, it seems to fare pretty well with all sorts of behavioural related addictions. 
    One thing we must understand is that video game addiction is fundamentally different from various other types of addictions. Unlike something like substance abuse, there is no physical substance at play here. Rather, it is the neurotransmitter in our brain known as dopamine that is released every time we do a pleasurable activity.
    Dopamine, in Layman's terms, is a chemical in our brain that is released when we do sometzhing pleasurable. It is often seen is the pleasure and motivation chemical, and this chemical is very powerful and essentially drives all forms of of what we do.
    In fact, a lack of dopamine actually leads to Parkinson's disease. This is because dopamine is also responsible for motor function. </p1>

    <h1> Strategy #2 - Competing Interests </h1>
    <p1> This is a pretty interesting strategy proposed by HealthyGamerGG. Although not flawless, it does emphasize the importance of fulfilling human needs as the core of video game addiction. 
    The one aspect that I think Healthy Gamer misses out on is the importance of resetting dopamine levels to baseline. I believe he does mention it sometimes, but it is not as emphasized as it should be. 
    In simple terms, it is very hard to find a competing interest if you are addicted to games. This is because gaming is more stimulating compared to other activities due to the nature of video games itself and the emphasis on adding addictive elements in modern games these days. 
    In my opinion, competing interests is simply a tool in your tool kit that you need to use with other tools to really curb your video game addiction. On its own, it simply won't be enough to quit gaming at all. 
    I think there is definitely a bit of an overemphasis from HealthyGamerGG, as he does not seem to mention anything about a 90 day detox anywhere, which is quite an important technique for video game addiction. </p1>
