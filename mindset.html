    <h1> What mindset should I have? </h1>
    <p1> Having a growth mindset is the most important thing out of everything. 
    The concept of a growth mindset is not super difficult to understand, but very difficult to execute. 
    For quitting gaming in particular, there are a few other mindsets and mindset shifts that you have to look at to really be able to make gaming not important to you at all. 
    The most important mindset to have is to change your identity. No, I don't mean creating a fake ID or something like that. I mean dissociating yourself with the mentality that "I'm a gamer". 
    When I tell people that video games aren't good for you, they get extremely offended by this because video games are something that they've known for their entire life, as it is part of them. 
    That's why it makes it so difficult to actually quit gaming, because they think that gaming is part of their personality. This is probably one of the most important things for building habits. 
    You need to really have that identity of someone who "doesn't play games" in order to stop gaming entirely. Identifying yourself as a gamer can be very problematic because it causes you to be very attached to games in general. 
    <br> </br> 
    Additionally, you need to realize that quitting gaming is not something that can be done overnight. There needs to be a systematic approach to it that accounts for potential pitfalls such as relapsing in order for your plan to be 
    successful. There are genuinely so many ups and downs when attempting to quit gaming since it is so habitual. Like changing any other habit, it takes quite a bit of dedication and focus to achieve. The thing with quitting gaming is 
    that gaming itself is engrained so deep into who you are. I remember playing video games since a very small age, so it has always just been a part of who I was, or at least I thought that was the case. Realizing that gaming is just one 
    of problematic habitual activities you do rather than somethig that is a part of who you are was singlehandedly one of the biggest mindset shifts I had. This could be the case for you, but with everyone's relationship with gaming, it can be 
    quite unique and there could be many nuances that I can't cover in one website. </p1>
