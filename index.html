<p1> If you are interested, you can also check out the Game Quitters YouTube channel, which is where my inspiration came from. </p1>
<p1> I actually got my inspiration for my channel from Game Quitters, as they already had plenty of good content and I thought I could contribute my own perspective to quitting video games as well </p1>
<p1> I must credit Game Quitters here, as a lot of the ideas I learned about quitting video games came from their channel, which is something I am so grateful for. </p1>
