<h1> Entry #1 - My First Ever Blog </h1>
<p1> Hello everyone! Welcome to my blog. In this blog I wanted to talk about why knowing about video game addiction is so important. Video game addiction, something that is often overlooked, is an issue that is plaguing today's society quite a bit. </p1>
<p1> I think that video games are often seen as pretty harmless, which does make sense, since most people think it's just a bit of fun and a way to relax after a hard day of work. </p1>
<p1> However, this is only the case for people who are not addicted to gaming. Gaming, like other forms of modern entertainment, is engineered to hook you. </p1>
<p1> Honestly, video game addiction is a pretty tough topic to discuss simply because there's not much awareness around the topic. After all, most people talk about social media as being very concerning, but video games are not really that different. </p1>
<p1> Everyone knows how social media is so damaging but the same principles are really applied everywhere in these modern technologies that they can pretty much all be grouped into one thing. </p1>
<p1> It's all really just instant gratification at the end of the day. There is a time and place for instant gratification, but these kind of things should not be a habit. Rather, it should be done very minimally or not at all. </p1>
<p1> This is not to hate on gaming, but rather to recognize the potential dangers that a video game addiction can cause. </p1>
