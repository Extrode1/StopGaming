    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <p1> Hello everyone! I'm a second year computer science student who struggled with a video game addiction for the majority of my life. 
    As someone who struggled with a video game addiction for nearly my entire life, I believe that there is not enough awareness about the topic. 
    In my free time, I like to solve Rubik's cubes competitively, play the piano, play baseball, go to the gym, code, and sing. 
    I hope to some day become a medical doctor or a computer science professor! I am not quite decided on my pathway as of now but both options sound quite intriguing to me. 
    I know that majoring in computer science to become a medical doctor does sound a bit strange, but it is something that I am truly passionate about. Medicine has fascinated me for quite a while by now. </p1>
