<h1>About Me </h1>
<p1>Hello everyone! I'm a first year computer science student who struggled with a video game addiction for the majority of my life. </p1>
<p1> As someone who struggled with a video game addiction for nearly my entire life, I believe that there is not enough awareness about the topic. </p1>
<p1> In my free time, I like to solve Rubik's cubes competitively, play the piano, play baseball, go to the gym, code, and sing. </p1>
<p1> I hope to some day become a medical doctor or a computer science professor! I am not quite decided on my pathway as of now but both options sound quite intriguing to me </p1>
