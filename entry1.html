<h1> Entry #1 - My First Ever Blog </h1>
<p1> Hello everyone! Welcome to my blog. In this blog I wanted to talk about why knowing about video game addiction is so important. Video game addiction, something that is often overlooked, is an issue that is plaguing today's society quite a bit. </p1>
<p1> I think that video games are often seen as pretty harmless, which does make sense, since most people think it's just a bit of fun and a way to relax after a hard day of work. </p1>
<p1> However, this is only the case for people who are not addicted to gaming. Gaming, like other forms of modern entertainment, is engineered to hook you. </p1>
