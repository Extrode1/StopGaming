<h1>What mindset should I have going into this process? </h1>
<p1>Having a growth mindset is the most important thing out of everything. </p1>
<p1> The concept of a growth mindset is not super difficult to understand, but very difficult to execute. </p1>
<p1> For quitting gaming in particular, there are a few other mindsets and mindset shifts that you have to look at to really be able to make gaming not important to you at all. </p1>
<p1> The most important mindset to have is to change your identity. No, I don't mean creating a fake ID or something like that. I mean dissociating yourself with the mentality that "I'm a gamer". </p1>
<p1> When I tell people that video games aren't good for you, they get extremely offended by this because video games are something that they've known for their entire life, as it is part of them. </p1>
<p1> That's why it makes it so difficult to actually quit gaming, because they think that gaming is part of their personality. </p1>
