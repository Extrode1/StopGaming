    <h1>What do I do when I quit gaming? </h1>
    <p1> Honestly, quitting gaming is a weird transition. At some times, it feels like everything is completely empty and barren, but as time goes on everything starts to adjust to normal. 
    The main issue with gaming is the dopamine levels that they release. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain, plays a huge role in everyday life due to how it works. 
    It seems that most people don't really understand how dopamine works. You don't 'get' dopamine, but rather dopamine is released in your brain when you do a pleasurable activity. 
    People don't really seem to understand that game developers main objective is to attract people to play their games and keep them there. That is simply how the economy works, via supply and demand. 
    Games are designed to be addicting. Video games, in and of itself, are not inherently 'bad'. However, modern games have much different intentions then say, Pac-Man, back in the day. </p1>

    <h1> How do I choose what hobbies to do? </h1>
    <p1> This is a great question but also quite nuanced. With hobbies, the goal is to essentially find multiple hobbies that, when combined together, fulfill all the needs that gaming once did. 
    This sounds pretty simple in theory, but actually implementing it is a bit difficult. Since you have most likely gamed for so long, it is just something that you are good at. 
    The issue is, you have developed so many skills within gaming so that the rest of your life is most likely affected if you had a serious gaming addiction like I did. 
    The most tricky part about finding new hobbies is getting through the initial learning curve. It's honestly very difficult to get through this part, as everything is just so difficult to start off and it can feel extremely overwhelming. 
    The most important thing that you need to realize is that you play games for a reason. It could be for so many different reasons, but that's something that you need to deeply reflect on. 
    Do you play games to pass time? Do you play games in order to feel a sense of achievement? Do you play games for social reasons? This is something that only you can answer and you need to really think about the reason that you play games. </p1>

    <h1> What hobbies did you end up choosing? </h1>
        <p1> One of the first hobbies I picked up when I quit gaming was cubing. Before I was extremely addicted to gaming, I had already started my hobby of cubing. However, since gaming got so addicting over time, 
            I slowly lost interest in all my other hobbies like playing the piano and cubing. Quitting gamign allowed me to start trying out hobbies that I had already done beforehand while also trying out new hobbies like 
            coding, baseball and programming.
